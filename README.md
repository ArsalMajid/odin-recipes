Iteration 1: Initial Structure
In the first iteration, you'll set up the foundational structure of your recipe website. Start by creating an index.html file within the odin-recipes directory. This file will serve as the homepage of your site. You'll fill this file with the basic HTML boilerplate, which includes the <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, and <body> tags. Inside the <body>, add a main heading <h1> with the text "Odin Recipes." This provides a clear title for your site and sets up the page for future content.

Iteration 2: Recipe Page
Next, create a subdirectory within odin-recipes named recipes to house individual recipe pages. Inside this new directory, create an HTML file for each recipe. Name these files after the recipes they will contain, such as lasagna.html. For now, each recipe page should simply have an <h1> heading with the recipe's name. This serves as a placeholder and helps you organize each recipe page. Return to index.html and add a link to the newly created recipe page. Use the <a> tag to link to recipes/recipename.html, and ensure the link text matches the recipe name for consistency and clarity.


Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content
In this iteration, you'll enhance each recipe page by adding detailed content. Begin by including an image of the finished dish below the <h1> heading to visually represent the recipe. Then, add a "Description" heading followed by a paragraph or two describing the recipe's details and background. Under the description, include an "Ingredients" heading and list the ingredients required for the recipe in an unordered list (<ul>). Finally, add a "Steps" heading and outline the preparation steps in an ordered list (<ol>). This structured content will make 
the recipe pages informative and user-friendly.

Iteration 4: Add More Recipes
For the final iteration, expand your recipe website by adding two additional recipe pages, each with the same structure as the first one you created. Ensure that each new recipe page includes an image, description, ingredients list, and preparation steps. Update the index.html file to include links to these new recipe pages. To keep the homepage organized, present the recipe links in an unordered list (<ul>) so that they are neatly arranged rather than appearing in a single line. This will make the navigation more intuitive and visually appealing for users.
