    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>This apple juice is super easy to make at home and requires no juicer! This is my mother's recipe
        — she had this creative way of using the leftover apple cores and peels (from baking pies) to
       make homemade apple juice. The juice is light and pleasantly sweet.</p>

    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>5 cups water</li>
        <li>3 peels and cores from red apples - seeds removed</li>
        <li>cup white sugar ¼</li>    
    </ul>   

    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Combine water with apple peels and cores in a saucepan. Bring to a boil,
            then reduce the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the apple
             flavor and color have permeated the water, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Strain apple juice into a mixing bowl; discard all solids.
             Stir in sugar until dissolved. Allow to cool for 30 minutes before drinking.</li>
    </ol>
