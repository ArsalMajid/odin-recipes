    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Lasagna is a beloved Italian dish characterized by its layers of rich, hearty ingredients.
       At its core, lasagna features sheets of pasta, often slightly wavy, which are alternated with
       layers of savory meat sauce, creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese, and a generous sprinkling of 
       mozzarella or Parmesan cheese. The meat sauce is typically made from ground beef or pork, 
       simmered with tomatoes, garlic, onions, and a blend of aromatic herbs like basil and oregano. 
       As it bakes, the layers meld together, creating a deliciously gooey, bubbling concoction with 
       a crispy, golden top. Each bite offers a comforting blend of flavors and textures, making 
       lasagna a quintessentially satisfying and indulgent dish that’s perfect for gatherings and 
       family meals.</p>
